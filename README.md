# VBA-Challenge
Stocks

Create a script that looped through all the stocks for one worksheet and resulted with the following information:

Displaying the ticker symbol in column I.

The script then looped through all the stocks to result in total stocks volume in column L.

Created a script to give an output for yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year in column J

Yearly Price = Close Price - Open Price of each given stock

Lastly, generated a script to give an output for the percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year in column K

Percent Change = (Yearly Price/Open Price) of each given stock

Applied conditional formatting that highlighted positive yearly change in green and negative yearly change in red.

Bonus!
Created a script in order to display, Greatest Percent Increase, Greatest Percent Decrease and Greatest Total Volume with their corresponding ticker names and values for the yearly stocks.
Finally, made appropriate adjustments to the script that allowed it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year just by running the script once.
